                            <p>I knew Pieter because he worked in a feature team I talked to regularly, and asked him to join my (Platform) team, basically because Pieter is the kind of guy you would want in any team. A critical thinker who challenges the status quo where needed.</p>

                                <li>He understands software development is there to serve a need from the business - and can think along with product management to get the best results. </li>
