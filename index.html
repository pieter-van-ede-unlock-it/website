                <section>
                    <p>Hello, nice to meet! I am Pieter, an experienced developer who enjoys being a Swiss army knife in any development team. I like getting into the code as much
                    as explaining the code to business and managers. But I also find a smooth development process important, so I always look for ways to make a team
                    perform even better. For instance by optimizing CI/CD usage, or improving the adoption of cloud, or writing technical stories or even target architectures
                    to bring an application to the next level.</p>

                    <p>If you would like to know more about me, then feel free to see what <a href="#testimonials">others say about me</a>, or see what <a href="#skills">skills</a> I can offer to your organisation.</p>

                            <p>I knew Pieter because he worked in a feature team I talked to regularly, and asked him to join my (Platform) team, basically because Pieter is the kind of guy you would want in any team. A critical thinker who challenges the status quo where needed.</p>
